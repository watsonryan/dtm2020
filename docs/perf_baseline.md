# Performance Baseline

Author: Watson

## Scope

Operational model throughput baseline for `Dtm2020Operational::Evaluate` using:
- profile preset (`macos-profile`)
- strict floating-point behavior (no fast-math)
- synthetic deterministic coefficient file generated by the benchmark executable

## Command

```bash
cmake --preset macos-profile
cmake --build --preset macos-profile -j
./build/macos-profile/tests/dtm2020_operational_perf_benchmark
```

## Baseline Result (2026-02-18)

```text
operational_perf benchmark
samples=15 corpus_size=4096 iterations=80
ns_per_eval_avg=541.89
ns_per_eval_median=542.70
ns_per_eval_p95=544.39
```

## Notes

- These numbers are machine/toolchain specific and should be treated as a local reference.
- Compare future optimization runs against median and p95 from the same command/preset.
