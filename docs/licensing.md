# Licensing Gate

Author: Watson

## Status

Blocked pending explicit license confirmation for derivative implementation and redistribution.

## Source Assets Under Review

- Fortran source from SWAMI MCM (`src/libswamif/dtm2020_F107_Kp-subr_MCM.f90`, `src/libswamif/dtm2020_sigma_function.f90`)
- Coefficient data files (`DTM_2020_F107_Kp.dat`, optional `DTM_2020_F30_ap60.dat`)

## Questions To Resolve

- Is derivative re-implementation in C++ permitted?
- Is redistribution of coefficient files permitted?
- Is commercial use permitted?
- Are clean-room constraints required?

## Interim Rule

No redistribution-oriented release work should proceed until these points are explicitly approved.
